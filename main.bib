  abstract = {Abstract Lithium-ion batteries have been used to operate various electric devices over the last decade. Electronic devices have been developed rapidly to achieve a high level of performance and enter into new markets. However, lithium-ion batteries face limitations as a result of the low theoretical energy density of existing materials. Thus, many researchers have sought to investigate different ways to enhance the performance of batteries when used for practical applications. This review revisits the literature related to the development of high performance lithium-ion batteries, which have been shown to have achieved outstanding results in a full cell test. In particular, the full cell test is critically important when seeking to develop materials that are appropriate for use in practical applications, and it also helps meet the increasing demands of new lithium-ion batteries that are a result of emerging technology. This review article aims to provide information about the development of lithium-ion batteries and the latest developments in new materials and nanotechnology. Furthermore, it will outline the challenges faced by the research community in developing advanced batteries and the outlook for the next generation of lithium-ion batteries.},
